# Boolean Network Behavioural (re)Differentiation

Master Thesis in Intelligent Robotic System for Computer Science and Engineering Master Course -- Alma Mater Studiorum

## Abstract

Realize an automatic design procedure that generates robot controllers based on Boolean networks capable to express behaviour re-differentiation. The agent should therefore be able, initially from a pluri-potent state due to the presence of noise, to differentiate into a precise behaviour depending on the environmental stimuli and, as these stimuli characterizing the environment change, express a new behaviour or return to its pluri-potent state.
